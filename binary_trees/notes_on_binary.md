# Binary Tree
Binary Tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data strcture where each node has at most two children referred to as left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and the bottom-most nodes are called leaves.

## Representation of Binary tree
Each node in Binary Tree has three parts:

- Root 
- Pointer to the left child 
- pointer to the right child 
  
## Terminologies in Binary Tree
- Nodes: The fundamental part of a binary tree, where  each node contains data and link to two child nodes.
- Root: The topmost node in a tree is known as the root node. It has no parent and serves as the starting point for all nodes in the tree.
- Parent Node: A node that has one or more child nodes. In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children.
- Child Node: A node that is a descendant of another node (its parent).
Leaf Node: A node that does not have any children or both children are null.
- Internal Node: A node that has at least one child. This includes all nodes except the root and the leaf nodes.
- Depth of a Node: The number of edges from a specific node to the root node. The depth of the root node is zero.
- Height of a Binary Tree: The number of nodes from the deepest leaf node to the root node.

## Traversal in Binary Tree
### 1. Inorder Traversal
        step 1: visit left node recursively
        step 2: visit node 
        step 3: visit right node recursively

### 2. Preorder Traversal
        step 1: visit node
        step 2: visit left node recursively
        step 3: visit right node recursively

### 3. Postorder Traversal
        step 1: visit left node recursively 
        step 2: visit right node recursively
        step 3: visit node
